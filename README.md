<blockquote><p><span>In collaboration with the Ricordi Archive, Dr. Patrizia Rebulla and Valeria Luti</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span>In 2024 will be the centenary of the death of Giacomo Puccini, one of the greatest authors of Casa Ricordi.</span>
<span>The great interest of Puccini is not only linked to his universal notoriety nor to the constant and still current success of his works, but also to his language, rich in Tuscanisms and inventions. The letters of Puccini can be studied from the perspective of sentiment analysis in order to link the text to several aspects of the temperament of Puccini, the moments of depression and discouragement from which he suffered periodically, his insecurity about his own abilities, certain difficulties in the relationship with his librettists.</span></p>

<p><span>The Ricordi Archive keeps 381 letters written by Puccini to various recipients of Casa Ricordi, and 1387 letters sent to him by the publishing house. To these are added another 120/130 letters present in the database but not kept in the archive. In total, therefore, it is about 2000 letters to be analyzed.</span></p>


<p><span>The project aims at studying the letters with aspect based sentiment analysis techniques in order to extract not only the general sentiment polarity but also specific aspects and opinions that may be associated with the events of the life of Giacomo Puccini.</span></p>
